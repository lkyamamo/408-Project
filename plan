1. use multipole expansion to determine V for dipole system
2. use py-pde to obtain the E field from this
3. directly calculate E field through superposition principle of particles
4. use fenics to solve the poisson equation given the same charge distribution
    a. 
5. (optional) use a known maxwell eq application to output the E and V fields of the same system
6. compare results with what was obtained through multipole expansion

presentation
1. go over quickly what we did in class for multipole expansion given a charge distribution and how to directly calculate for point particles
2. show how it applies to the simple point diple case and show results of this method
3. show that since we have simple distributions we are able to obtain the electric field through superposition of point particle electric fields
4. go over limitations of this method
    a. given more complex charge distributions will not be able to solve easily even if geometry has high symmetry
5. go over what numerical solvers are actually doing
    a. using calculus of variations to obtain the correct functions 
    b. go over basic concept where you start with a trial function and continually apply variations to it till you obtain the "optimal" function
6. show results of using this method with point particle distribution
    a. explain necessary adjustments that were made in order to actually calculate something
        i. approximation of delta function using continuous functions (gaussian?)
